Class: Rectangle

    Bug 1:

        Describe the bug/error:
        getPerimeter() is adding width and height together, which is not the formula for getting the perimeter of a rectangle

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
        Function: getPerimeter()
        Line: 52

        What test helped you find the bug?
        getPerimeter_shouldReturn_thePerimeterOfRectangle()

        What did you do to fix the bug?
        Changed the return statement to the proper formula for calculating the perimeter of a rectangle

    Bug 2:

        Describe the bug/error:
        getArea() does not check if the height or width is negative, so it calculates a negative area.

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
        Function: getArea()
        Line: 40

        What test helped you find the bug?
        getArea_shouldReturnZero_whenWidthOrHeightIsZeroOrLess()

        What did you do to fix the bug?
        Added a conditional statement that returns 0 if the width or height is 0 or less.
